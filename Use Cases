For your inventory management web application to be classified as a well-rounded and functional project, it should address a variety of basic use cases that cover the essential aspects of inventory management. Here are some key use cases that your app should ideally support:

### 1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
- **Use Case**: Users can log in to the system using their credentials. Different users (e.g., administrators, managers, staff) have different levels of access and permissions based on their roles.

### 2. **Add Inventory Items**
- **Use Case**: Users can add new inventory items to the system, specifying details such as name, category, price, quantity, supplier, and a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).

### 3. **View Inventory List**
- **Use Case**: Users can view a list of all inventory items. This list can be searched, filtered, and sorted by various attributes like name, category, quantity, or status (e.g., in stock, low stock).

### 4. **Update Inventory Items**
- **Use Case**: Users can update details of existing inventory items, such as modifying quantity, price, or description.

### 5. **Delete Inventory Items**
- **Use Case**: Users can delete inventory items from the system when they are no longer available or needed.

### 6. **Track Inventory Levels**
- **Use Case**: The system automatically updates inventory levels as items are added, sold, or adjusted, and alerts users when stock levels are low based on predefined thresholds.

### 7. **Generate Reports**
- **Use Case**: Users can generate and export reports that summarize inventory data, such as sales reports, stock levels, and inventory valuation. These reports help in making informed business decisions.

### 8. **Place Orders**
- **Use Case**: Users can place orders for new stock directly through the app. This may include selecting items, specifying quantities, and confirming supplier details.

### 9. **Receive Stock**
- **Use Case**: Users can mark inventory items as received, updating the inventory count. This process might include checking ordered items against received items for accuracy.

### 10. **Audit and History Tracking**
- **Use Case**: The system keeps a log of all transactions and modifications to inventory items, providing an audit trail that can be reviewed for accuracy or compliance purposes.

### 11. **Manage Suppliers**
- **Use Case**: Users can manage supplier information, including contact details, preferred payment methods, and historical data regarding reliability and order fulfillment.

### 12. **Integration with Other Systems**
- **Use Case**: The system integrates with other business tools such as accounting software, CRM systems, or e-commerce platforms to ensure seamless data flow and operations.

### 13. **Dashboard and Analytics**
- **Use Case**: Users have access to a dashboard that provides at-a-glance views of critical metrics such as total inventory value, fast-moving items, and recent transactions. Analytical tools help predict trends and prepare for future demand.

### 14. **Mobile Accessibility**
- **Use Case**: Users can access the inventory system through a mobile interface, allowing them to manage and view inventory from anywhere, enhancing flexibility and response time.

Including these use cases will make your inventory management web application robust, user-friendly, and valuable for managing day-to-day operations efficiently. Each use case should be defined in detail in your system's requirements to ensure full functionality and user satisfaction.
